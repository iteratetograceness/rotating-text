# Changelog

## 1.0.5 (2026-09-20)

### Fixes

- Letters added after the first render (for example when `text` changes) no
  longer get an undefined animation duration. When `timing` is an array
  shorter than the text, the remaining letters reuse its last entry.
- The container no longer gets a stray `undefined` class when no `className`
  is passed.

### Docs

- The README usage example now uses the named `RotatingText` export and the
  `style` prop, and declares `MyApp` correctly.
- The README documents every prop with its type and default.

### Internal

- Added a Vitest and React Testing Library test suite (`npm test`).
- Dev dependencies now use React 18, matching the `react` peer range.
- Removed the unused Travis config.

## 1.0.4 (2023-02-03)

- Last release before this changelog was started.
